# Finite Element method (
2020)
## Introduction
Welcome to the Finite Element Method (FEM) project for MATLAB! This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for getting started, details about its usage for solving the 1D and 2D Laplace equations with both rectangles and triangles, features, and how to contribute.
## Project Overview
The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). 
This project focuses on implementing FEM solvers for two important Laplace equations:

1. **1D Laplace Equation**: Describes steady-state heat conduction along a one-dimensional domain.
2. **2D Laplace Equation**: Models steady-state heat conduction or potential fields in a two-dimensional region. This project provides implementations for both rectangular and triangular elements.
This project aims to provide versatile MATLAB-based FEM solvers for these equations, making it accessible for engineers, scientists, and researchers in various fields, including heat transfer, structural analysis, and electromagnetics.
